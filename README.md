#Hello!
There are some exercise solutions from **[Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)** by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

They are grouped by chapters. Every exercise contains **[PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit)** test file in `/tests` folder, if possible. You can run it with `phpunit tests` command. Also every exercise folder has its own `README.md` with description. 

I hope this project helps to the beginners to understand how the exercises from this book are solved using PHP language.
